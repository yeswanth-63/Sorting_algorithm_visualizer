# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

### Project Task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this project is to create an generated user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter module to generate random arrays of data values in the form of a bargraph and implement sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort to sort the data values and show an animation of how the array is sorted at each step.  
### Results
<br>

## BubbleSort algorithm, this is how the algorithm is expected to go about sorting an array: 
![Description 1](https://github.com/yeswanth-63/Sorting_algorithm_visualizer/blob/main/gifs/Bubble%20Sort%20.gif )

once a random array of data values is generated it is always denoted as **red** meaning the data values are **unsorted**. When two arrays are highlighted in **purple** that meant to denote that the values are about to be **swapped** and once the **sorting is comeplete** all the bars in the graph are colored in **blue**.
