# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

### Project Task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this project is to create an generated user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter module to generate random arrays of data values in the form of a bargraph and implement sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort to sort the data values and show an animation of how the array is sorted at each step.
